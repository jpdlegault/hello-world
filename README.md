My take on the most written applet in the world, Hello there!
Hi!
My name is Daniel Legault. I am Canadian from Lasalle (a burrough of Montreal) Qc
I have been a programmer for an extended period of time and am now semi retired.
As of today, I am 65 years old and my last contract as a senior programmer analyst was at McGill University until May 2003.
I am fluent in Oracle pl/sql and act as a DBA without the diploma, VB 1.0 to VB 2015, VS2003, 2005, 2008,..., MS SQL Server, and more ...
But this is something I am not familiar with at all, namely the Open Source world, but I want to learn and if or when I can, I could perhaps contribute to the global effort ...
I am glad to be here and you all seem like like a great bunch of well organized people. I like that!

So, if you'll have me, I'll learn and see how I can possibly pitch in. :)

Daniel Legault
